## Development Principles

### Privacy First
- All AI processing defaults to client-side
- Server processing requires explicit opt-in
- Users own and control all their data
- Metadata can be deleted at any time

### Progressive Enhancement
- Each phase builds on the previous
- Features are optional and can be disabled
- Core functionality always available
- No breaking changes between phases

### Performance Focus
- Fast load times are critical
- Efficient client-side processing
- Smart caching strategies
- Batch operations where possible

### User Control
- Granular privacy settings
- Clear data usage communication
- Easy feature toggle options
- Transparent processing indicators

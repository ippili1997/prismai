## Development Principles

### Privacy First
- No file content ever touches our servers
- All data stays in user's own buckets
- AI processing defaults to client-side
- Explicit opt-in for any server processing

### User Control
- Users maintain complete ownership of data
- Granular privacy settings
- All features are optional
- Easy data export/deletion

### Progressive Enhancement
- Each phase builds on the previous
- No breaking changes between phases
- Core functionality always available
- Features can be disabled

### Performance Focus
- Direct browser-to-bucket operations
- Efficient client-side processing
- Smart caching strategies
- Optimized for large directories
